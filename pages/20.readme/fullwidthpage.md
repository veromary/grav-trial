### Easily Publish, Share and Collaborate using Grav Open Course Hub!  

1. Create a new [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository (hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or your own server) with at least one commit.
2. Tap the 'SETUP GIT SYNC' link on the far-right of the site navigation bar of this page for step-by-step instructions.
3. Go to the Git Sync Link Setup options on the [Admin Site Configuration panel](../../admin/config/site) to change the display and functionality of the automatically displayed Git Sync Link (including not displaying it).

### Extend the Capabilities of Your Learning Management System (LMS)  

By adding the URL parameter (i.e. flag) `chromeless:true` to any Open Course Hub page you can display that page's content without the global header image, site navigation bar, sidebar and footer - a great way to seamlessly embed Open Course Hub pages into other systems.  

For example, the URL [http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub/schedule](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub/schedule) displays the standard Open Course Hub page but the URL [http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub/schedule/chromeless:true](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub/schedule/chromeless:true) will only display that page's content. Any links between Open Course Hub pages will result in pages being displayed in the same manner.

### Additional Open Course Hub Site Examples ##
You can download two other variations of Open Course Hub package - [Basic Course Hub](http://hibbittsdesign.org/blog/downloads/grav-skeleton-course-hub-site-basic.zip) (with fewer example pages and features shown) or [Advanced Course Hub](http://hibbittsdesign.org/blog/downloads/grav-skeleton-course-hub-site-advanced.zip) (with more example pages and features shown). There is also a [Multi-course Hub](http://learn.hibbittsdesign.org/coursehub/multi-course-hubs), designed to house several courses. All of these examples are available in the Open Course Hub folder `/user/themes/course-hub-bootstrap/_demo/`
